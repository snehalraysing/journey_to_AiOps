Containerizartion - Docker Fundamentals
1: Physical sever provisioning 
2: H/W Virtualization 
hypervisior -> we can use more than single os in single h/w
ESXi (vmware)
kvm(redhat)
hyper 
WSL (windows subsystem linux) using hyper-v it is running.
Cloud computing is also hyper-visior

3: os Virtualization
app
lib
dependency
But it shares kernel

Docker Engine -> core componenet that runs container


* Container Engines * all are runtime
dockerd (developed docker community)
containerd (developed docker community)
cri-io  (developed by redhat and ibm, openshift used for redhat)

Kubernetes - when to manage different containers

Docker Client -> where we can run docker command
Docker Daemon background service that build image, run container, manage resources


4: Container

server -> who serves something to the client eg. java servers, http servers

* Install docker Engine *
-- package requirement
dnf install docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

systemctl start docker
systemctl status docker
systemctl is-enabled docker
systemctl status docker  (enabled)

docker --version  
docker run hello-world

* in powershell *
wsl --status
docker --version
docker run hello-world (daemon service needs to be enabled need to open docker desktop)

docker ps  (all containers list on the system)
docker ps -a (list of running containers)
docker images
docker run -d -p 8085:80 nginx (daemon mode, port)
nginx (port 80 is running in ngnix, so we are forwarding 85 to 80 port)

docker stop ngnix
docker ps
docker ps -a

localhost:8085

To start again
docker start container_name/ container_id
docker ps -a

* how to save
docker run -d -p 8086:80 nginx

docker run -d -p 8087:80 --name hexanginx nginx  (give new name)

docker exec -it hexanginx  /bin/bash  (login)
-> image_id

cat /etc/hosts (to check ip address)
